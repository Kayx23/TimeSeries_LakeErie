# 4A03 Project

"...The report should be from 5 to no more than 10 double-spaced single-column pages using a font size 10-12, not including images and graphs."

".... In an individual contribution form, which is to be completed at the end of the project, you will be asked to summarize the contribution of each of your group members and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the team. While the project grade is primarily a group grade, individual grades will be adjusted based on your own contribution and your peer assessments."

"... Time management is going to play an important role in the project. Create and follow a schedule that enables your group to successfully complete all written deliverables."

W/o transforming the series, it already looks like it has a constant variance. Transformations I tried made the AIC worse in the model selection. So I went ahead and found my best model to be ARIMA(1,0,2)(1,1,1)12

ARIMA(1,0,2)(2,1,1)12 performs similarly too
