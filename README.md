### Notes
Excerpt from Chapter 1.2 A Model-Building Strategy:

> ...There are three main steps in the process, each of which may be used several times:

> 1. model specification (or identification)
> 2. model fitting, and
> 3. model diagnostics

> In model specification, we look at the time plot of the series, compute many different statistics from the data, and also apply any knowledge of the subject matter in which the data arise. It should be emphasized that the model chosen at this point is tentative and subject to revision later on in the analysis. In choosing a model, __we shall attempt to adhere to the principle of parsimony; that is, the model used should require the smallest number of parameters that will adequately represent the time series.
